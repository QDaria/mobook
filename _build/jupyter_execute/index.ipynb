    "## Sample Roles and Directives\n",
    "\n",
    "Roles and directives are two of the most powerful tools in Jupyter Book. They\n",
    "are kind of like functions, but written in a markup language. They both\n",
    "serve a similar purpose, but **roles are written in one line**, whereas\n",
    "**directives span many lines**. They both accept different kinds of inputs,\n",
    "and what they do with those inputs depends on the specific role or directive\n",
    "that is being called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a \"note\" directive:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Here is a note\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be rendered in a special box when you build your book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an inline directive to refer to a document: {doc}`markdown-notebooks`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Citations\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,\n",
    "the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like\n",
    "this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:\n",
    "The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to\n",
    "render properly.\n",
    "For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,\n",
    "then the bibliography is inserted with:\n",

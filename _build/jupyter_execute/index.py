# # Notebooks with MyST Markdown
# 
# Jupyter Book also lets you write text-based notebooks using MyST Markdown.
# See [the Notebooks with MyST Markdown documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/myst-notebooks.html) for more detailed instructions.
# This page shows off a notebook written in MyST Markdown.
# 
# ## An example cell
# 
# With MyST Markdown, you can define code cells with a directive like so:

# In[2]:


print(2 + 2)


# When your book is built, the contents of any `{code-cell}` blocks will be
# executed with your default Jupyter kernel, and their outputs will be displayed
# in-line with the rest of your content.
# 
# ```{seealso}
# Jupyter Book uses [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to convert text-based files to notebooks, and can support [many other text-based notebook files](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/jupytext.html).
# ```
# 
# ## Create a notebook with MyST Markdown
# 
# MyST Markdown notebooks are defined by two things:
# 
# 1. YAML metadata that is needed to understand if / how it should convert text files to notebooks (including information about the kernel needed).
#    See the YAML at the top of this page for example.
# 2. The presence of `{code-cell}` directives, which will be executed with your book.
# 
# That's all that is needed to get started!
# 
# ## Quickly add YAML metadata for MyST Notebooks
# 
# If you have a markdown file and you'd like to quickly add YAML metadata to it, so that Jupyter Book will treat it as a MyST Markdown Notebook, run the following command:
# 
# ```
# jupyter-book myst init path/to/markdownfile.md
# ```
# # Markdown Files
# 
# Whether you write your book's content in Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) or
# in regular markdown files (`.md`), you'll write in the same flavor of markdown
# called **MyST Markdown**.
# This is a simple file to help you get started and show off some syntax.
# 
# ## What is MyST?
# 
# MyST stands for "Markedly Structured Text". It
# is a slight variation on a flavor of markdown called "CommonMark" markdown,
# with small syntax extensions to allow you to write **roles** and **directives**
# in the Sphinx ecosystem.
# 
# For more about MyST, see [the MyST Markdown Overview](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html).
# 
# ## Sample Roles and Directives
# 
# Roles and directives are two of the most powerful tools in Jupyter Book. They
# are kind of like functions, but written in a markup language. They both
# serve a similar purpose, but **roles are written in one line**, whereas
# **directives span many lines**. They both accept different kinds of inputs,
# and what they do with those inputs depends on the specific role or directive
# that is being called.
# 
# Here is a "note" directive:
# 
# ```{note}
# Here is a note
# ```
# 
# It will be rendered in a special box when you build your book.
# 
# Here is an inline directive to refer to a document: {doc}`markdown-notebooks`.
# 
# 
# ## Citations
# 
# You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,
# the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like
# this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.
# 
# Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:
# The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to
# render properly.
# For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,
# then the bibliography is inserted with:
# 
# ```{bibliography}
# ```

# 
# This is just a simple starter to get you started.
